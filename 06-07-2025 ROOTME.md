### Forth Question:- Find directories on the web server using the GoBuster tool.
11.
### Fifth Question:- What is the hidden directory?
12.
13. We can see from the screenshot that there are useful directries like js,css but our answer is of 5 letter directory name :- <ins><b> /panel/ </b></ins>
## Task 3:-
### user.txt?
We first tried to upload Shell.php into the site but was not able to then we tried to try different php extensions like .php2,.php3,.php4 etc.
<br>
Luckily .php5 worked and we were able to upload reverse shell into the site.<br>
But still we are not able to get a shell. For it we need to run that file which can be done by going to another directory /uploads/.<br>
We will run 
```
nc -lvnp 1234
```
